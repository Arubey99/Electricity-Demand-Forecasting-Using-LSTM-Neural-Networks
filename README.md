# Electricity Demand Forecasting Using LSTM Neural Networks

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook aimed at forecasting electricity demand through the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Developed for analyzing electricity consumption data, the project leverages time-series analysis to predict future energy demand patterns accurately.

## Project Overview

The project trains an LSTM model using historical electricity consumption data to forecast future demand. LSTMs, well-suited for time-series tasks, capture temporal dependencies in electricity usage patterns, enabling accurate predictions over specified time intervals.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Efficient handling and cleaning of time-series electricity consumption data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extraction of relevant features such as temperature and seasonal factors to improve model accuracy.
- **LSTM Model Implementation:** Training and fine-tuning of an LSTM neural network for optimal predictive performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Analysis of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Required Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
